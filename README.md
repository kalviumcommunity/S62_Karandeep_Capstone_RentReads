## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Many individuals possess digital books (e.g., PDFs) that they wish to share, but there is no convenient, seamless platform for doing so. Readers are often looking for temporary access to books without the need to purchase or permanently own them. Current platforms for book sharing or rentals are either focused on physical books or fail to address the unique needs of digital formats. As a result, there is no effective solution for renting, sharing, or returning digital books in a manner that ensures availability for others after a specified period. Additionally, there is no simple way to track book usage or enforce the return of inactive rentals, preventing books from being made available to other users. This gap in the market creates significant barriers for both book owners and readers who want a flexible, user-friendly system for digital book access. 
**We aim to address this gap by creating a solution that allows for seamless sharing, rental, and return of digital books, ensuring efficient usage and availability for all users.**
